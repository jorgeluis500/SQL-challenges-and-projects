"[24/05/2019, 10:49:56] Sam: Each night upon the other looked of the guests assembled there."
"[24/05/2019, 10:50:28] James: Upon their cheeks a furious rage paled to a ghastly fear and strangled breath from lips like death was all that could be heard, when, like a white defenceless dove arose an ancient bard, here there is one to tell thy deeds, chanted the ancient seer, the clash of battle, the hoarse death rattle, the plucked strings made them hear."
"[24/05/2019, 16:11:32] Hafeez: The clash of battle, the hoarse death rattle, on blood the sun setting."
"[24/05/2019, 21:55:19] Hanna Ny: The stench that drew night - prowling beasts."

"[28/05/2019, 15:49:31] Hanna Ny: You did all this, O King!"

"[28/05/2019, 21:28:06] Hesham: Ordered King Edward."
"[28/05/2019, 21:29:21] Hesham: Come, let us have a gentler tune forth stepped a young Welsh bard."
"[29/05/2019, 14:01:53] Paul: Soft breezes sigh in the evening sky."
"[01/06/2019, 19:55:57] ?Alessandro?: O'er Milford Haven blown."
"[04/06/2019, 21:54:30] Hanna Ny: Maids' sobbing tears and widows' prayers within those breezes moan."
"[04/06/2019, 22:04:16] Jenny: Don't bear a race of slaves ye maids!"
"[05/06/2019, 12:40:57] Sam: Mothers give such no more!"
"[06/06/2019, 12:07:52] Hafeez: The King spoke and the boy caught up the old man sent before."
"[06/06/2019, 18:21:38] Joe?: But though unasked, yet recklessly advanced, unmoved, a third his lyre's fierce song, like the Welsh bard strong, and his word must be heard. Our bravest fell on the battle field. Listen O Edward. To sing the praises of your name there is not one Welsh bard! One memory sobs within my lyre."
"[06/06/2019, 18:22:31] Kolsuma: Listen O Edward."
"[07/06/2019, 18:10:04] Sam: A curse on your brow every song you hear from a Welshman and a bard!"
"[07/06/2019, 19:21:11] ?Alessandro?: Enough of this! I orders give."
"[11/06/2019, 19:22:11] Hafeez: Answered the furious King."
"[13/06/2019, 14:35:39] Paul: To send to the stake all the bards of Wales who thus against me sing!"
"[13/06/2019, 19:51:07] Kolsuma: His servants till their task was done."
"[13/06/2019, 20:22:38] Sam: Their searching never ceased."
"[14/06/2019, 08:45:28] Jenny: Thus grimly in Montgomery, ended that famous feast."
"[14/06/2019, 11:58:53] Tom  Prowse: Edward the King, the English King."
"[14/06/2019, 18:33:15] Kolsuma: Spurred his dapple grey charger."
"[17/06/2019, 19:02:23] Hafeez: On the skies around, stakes burning stand in the Welsh lands over the border."
"[18/06/2019, 09:16:16] ?Alessandro?: Five hundred went to a flaming grave, and singing every bard."
"[18/06/2019, 17:06:51] Sam: Not one of them was found to cry."
"[18/06/2019, 17:47:19] Sam: Long live King Edward!"
"[18/06/2019, 19:08:30] Jenny: What murmur is this in the London streets?"
"[19/06/2019, 17:38:28] Bona: What night song can this be?"
"[21/06/2019, 18:08:35] Paul: I will have London's Lord Mayor hanged if any noise troubles me."
"[22/06/2019, 12:09:03] ?Alessandro?: Within, a fly's wing must not move, outside all silence keep."
"[24/06/2019, 15:30:04] Kolsuma: The man who speaks will lose his head."
"[24/06/2019, 15:30:30] Sam: The monarch cannot sleep."
"[24/06/2019, 15:56:41] Natalia: No!"
"[24/06/2019, 16:19:11] Kolsuma: Bring me the music of pipe and drum, and the trumpet's brazen roar."
"[25/06/2019, 16:00:06] Bona: For the curses I heard at the Welshman's feast ascend to my ears once more!"
"[11/07/2019, 21:50:15] Paul: But above the music of pipe and drum and the bugles' strong refrain."
"[11/07/2019, 21:50:16] Kami: Loud cry those witnesses of blood."
"[11/07/2019, 21:55:00] Hesham: Five hundred Welsh bards slain."
